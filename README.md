## Medio: Database Project
✨Medio is a plastic recycling application which connects consumers to plastic recycling facilities by acting as a medium between them.

✨Consumers can request plastic pickup after which a pickup person will arrive at their home to pick up the waste. After collecting the trash, it will be transported to the nearest plastic recycling facility.

✨We have used Python and MySQL for creating the application
